This analysis note will present the detailed measurement of positive pion photoproduction in the 730-2300 MeV photon energy (1400-2290 MeV centre-of-mass energy) region with a linearly polarised photon beam and a longitudinally polarised proton target with a close-to-complete angular coverage in detection of the reaction products. This unique set up allows for the extraction of the double-polarisation observable, G. The data were taken as part of the g9 experiment using a tagged, polarised photon beam and the Frozen Proton Spin Target (FROST)
